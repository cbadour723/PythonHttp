WEB SERVER README:

This project teaches us how a server and client communicate
by sending and recieving html files

The Server must be up in running first, then run client
and enter the Server information. After this type the absolute
file path to get the file. The client should then print the file

- run server
- run client
- enter server info
- enter file path
- client should return HTTP/1.1 200 OK
